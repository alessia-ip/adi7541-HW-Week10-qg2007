 Joint homework project


### TODO
1. Function - click 2 tiles, checks if they're the same type, AND have a clear path between them (tiles disappear)
2. Dictionary (string, int) - resource type, amount gained. -> make tiles drop a random number of resources each tile they are cleared. 
3. Randomizer for the tiles so we get all the resources on the grid -> make sure there are at least 5 that show up on the grid
4. Make things with the resources you've gathered (this subtracts them from the dictionary) 
5. Something for UI to update this info
6. Something to reset the grid but have persistent resources (saving)


### Work Breakdown
1 & 3 -> Joy

2 & 5 -> Yanxi

4 & 6 ->  Alessia
